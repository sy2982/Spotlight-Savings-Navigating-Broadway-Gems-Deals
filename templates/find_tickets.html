            <li>Proceed to checkout. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Ensure the website’s security</span> by checking for 'https://' in the URL and a lock icon near the address bar.</li>
            <li>Finalize your purchase and receive a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">confirmation email</span> with your tickets.</li>

    <button class="accordion">Ticket Lotteries</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p> - Your Chance for the Spotlight</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review the list of shows offering digital lotteries. Find ones you’re interested in and <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">go to the lottery websites.</span></li>
            <li>Choose a show and click <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">'Enter Lottery'</span> to begin the process. <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Submit</span> your entry.</li>

    <button class="accordion">Rush Tickets & Standing Room Only (SRO)</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Rush tickets are <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">offered on the day of the performance</span>, usually when the box office opens. They are sold at a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">discount</span>, but quantities are limited and seats are often <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">first come, first served</span>. Some theaters have general rush tickets, while others offer <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">Student Rush tickets</span>, requiring a valid student ID.</p>
        <p>When a show is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">sold out</span>, theaters sometimes offer SRO tickets at a discounted rate. These are exactly what they sound like—you'll be watching the performance from a <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">designated standing area</span>. These are usually sold on the day of the performance, <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">directly from the box office.</span></p>
