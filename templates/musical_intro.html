        The quintessential Broadway experience is encapsulated in the musical genre, a celebration of storytelling that marries melody with movement.

    <h2 class="section-title">Defining the Genre:</h2>
    <p class="genre-description">
        At its core, a musical is a theatrical production where songs drive the narrative forward. Unlike plays where dialogue takes precedence, in musicals, the music, lyrics, and dance numbers play a fundamental role in storytelling. Each musical number is crafted to reveal character motivations, advance the plot, or evoke a deeper connection with the audience.
