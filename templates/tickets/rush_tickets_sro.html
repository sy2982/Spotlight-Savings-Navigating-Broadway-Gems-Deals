    <h2>Rush Tickets & Standing Room Only (SRO)</h2>
    <p>Rush tickets are offered on the day of the performance, usually when the box office opens. They are sold at a discount, but quantities are limited and seats are often first come, first served. Some theaters have general rush tickets, while others offer Student Rush tickets, requiring a valid student ID.</p>
    <p>When a show is sold out, theaters sometimes offer SRO tickets at a discounted rate. These are exactly what they sound likeâ€”you'll be watching the performance from a designated standing area. These are usually sold on the day of the performance, directly from the box office.</p>
